What is the “Digital Supply Chain” and why is it important to your organisation and to DevOps as a practice?

The concept of the “Digital Supply Chain” is a different way of looking at the SDLC and the Continuous Delivery “pipeline” that we feel makes it easier for traditional organisations to understand the criticality of software delivery (and by extension DevOps) in the modern world.

Any organisation that deals with physical goods understands the concept of the supply chain. They are intimately familiar with ideas like supply chain management, supply chain optimisation and, most importantly, they understand the economics of inventory in the supply chain e.g the carrying cost of inventory.


So what is the “Digital Supply Chain”?

The current definitions of the digital supply chain are anchored in the “New Media” sector and focus on digital assets like music, video etc

“The “digital supply chain” is a “new media” term which encompasses the process of the delivery of digital media, be it music or video, by electronic means, from the point of origin (content provider) to destination (consumer).” – Wikipedia
