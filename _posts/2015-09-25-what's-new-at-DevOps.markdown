We’re really excited about the programming we have planned for the DevOps Enterprise Summit 2015. Here are some things you may have expected: We will bring back more of your favorite presenters Tell new chapters in stories of transformation and acceleration Introduce an exciting new set of top experts, case studies, and practitioner-led research We also have a really unexpected surprise

During last year’s event, we established that many large organizations were already on the path to adopting DevOps practices, and our speakers shared their struggles from the stage.

After the event, we wanted to learn more about what the biggest roadblocks were for our attendees in their own companies, so what did we do?

We sent a post-conference survey, asking last year’s attendees to tell us their biggest challenges as they returned back to their companies.
