      <p>DevOps is a philosophy; it’s a way of life that you can use to transform your business methodology, improve your customer communications and revolutionise your results.</p>

<p>We’ve collated some fundamental DevOps principles that you can apply to all your business practises to streamline processes, revolutionise thinking and improve internal and external communications: Keep CALMS and use DevOps.</p>

<p>Culture – Let yourself Fail</p>

<p>“The one who falls and gets up is stronger than the one who never fell.” It may be a cliché, but we really do learn from our mistakes. Don’t be afraid to try things, but learn to fail safely and make sure you learn from things that don’t work out.</p>

<p>Constant testing, re-evaluation and development is the only way to keep up with the modern world and this can be applied to software development, marketing strategies, personal goals – anything!</p>

<p>Automation – Focus on your business</p>

<p>Modern technology allows you to automate loads of areas of your life to free up your time – without it, juggling work, family, friends and the other components of contemporary culture would be impossible.</p>

<p>Automating systems and processes at work not only eliminates the risk of human error, but it frees up time to focus on the running of your business. Without having to spend man-power on monitoring, testing and updating your software you can focus more time into making your business the best it can be. Automation also means that your release processes are consistent, reliable and specific to your needs.</p>

<p>Lean – Cut down on waste</p>

<p>Originally devised and initiated by Toyota ‘Lean’ is a way of working that improves flow and eliminates waste: making obvious what adds value by reducing everything else. Implementing a Lean system in your processes means discarding superfluous, ‘wasteful’ activity and focusing on efficiently achieving your end result. These processes also reduce costs and production time as well as improving productivity.</p>

<p>This is ideal for efficiency in and out of the work environment – whether your new year’s resolution is to be more productive in your spare time, to recycle more or to get fit, try applying Lean principles to your day-to-day goals!</p>
